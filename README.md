# Ties

**Ties** is a physics-based arena (puzzle?) game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Two balls, one controlled by you, and one by an AI, bounce around inside a circular arena.  
Each time a ball hits the arena’s boundary, it creates a glowing **“tie”**, a line tethered between the point of impact and the ball.

Your goal?  
**Cut all of your opponent’s ties before they cut yours.**

![Demo](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/0239fdf3c196b3fb97adf57f837cae44cc5b8fdc_ties.gif)

- The arena is a perfect circle.
- There are **two balls**:
  - 🟢 **Player Ball**: controlled by you.
  - 🔴 **Enemy Ball**: moves randomly.
- When a ball **bounces off the arena’s edge**, it forms a **tie**.
- You can **cut enemy ties** by colliding with them.
- If all your ties are cut, **you lose**.
- If the enemy’s ties are cut first, **you win!**
